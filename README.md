# hcx_sdk

hcx_sdk repository uses hcx-integrator-sdk and hapi fhir sdks to construct examples of different FHIR resources as per 
standards published in IG https://ig.hcxprotocol.io/v0.7.1/index.html. This repository establishes a connection with HCX
using hcx-integrator-sdk and contains examples to send and receive API calls for Swasth HCX instance.

### List of FHIR resource examples available
1. CoverageEligibilityRequest
2. CoverageEligibilityResponse
3. Claim
4. ClaimResponse
5. Coverage
6. Patient
7. Organization
8. Communication
9. CommunicationRequest
10. PaymentReconciliation
11. PaymentNotice




We will now create a    CoverageEligibilityRequest example below, codes are also available in file HCXCoverageEligibility.java

        /**
        * We will now try to create a Coverage Eligibility Request as per
        * https://ig.hcxprotocol.io/v0.7.1/StructureDefinition-CoverageEligibilityRequest.html
        */

        CoverageEligibilityRequest ce = new CoverageEligibilityRequest();
        ce.setId("dc82673b-8c71-48c2-8a17-16dcb3b035f6");

        /**
         * Meta is not a mandatory field as per the definitions, but we need to include HCX profile links in resource field in meta
         * to ensure that the resource is validated against given HCX FHIR profile. In below case, as we are creating a coverage eligibility
         * request as per https://ig.hcxprotocol.io/v0.7/StructureDefinition-CoverageEligibilityRequest.html so we need to give the
         * same link the Meta resource
         */
        Meta meta = new Meta();
        meta.getProfile().add(new CanonicalType("https://ig.hcxprotocol.io/v0.7/StructureDefinition-CoverageEligibilityRequest.html"));
        ce.setMeta(meta);

        /**
         * We will now be providing other mandatory fields as oer the HCX FHIR standards.
         * We are using sample values in most places. Please replace the values as per your needs.
         */

        /**
         * Identifiers are mandatory in almost all resource definitions.
         * Identifier has two main components, a System and a Code. We need to provide a System which is a URL that
         * contains the organization or participants identifier code such as Rohini ID etc.
         */

        ce.getIdentifier().add(new Identifier().setValue("req_70e02576-f5f5-424f-b115-b5f1029704d4"));
        ce.setStatus(CoverageEligibilityRequest.EligibilityRequestStatus.ACTIVE);
        ce.setPriority(new CodeableConcept(new Coding().setSystem("http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/processpriority").setCode("normal")));

        EnumFactory<CoverageEligibilityRequest.EligibilityRequestPurpose> fact = new CoverageEligibilityRequest.EligibilityRequestPurposeEnumFactory();
        ce.setPurpose(List.of((Enumeration) new Enumeration<>(fact).setValue(CoverageEligibilityRequest.EligibilityRequestPurpose.BENEFITS)));

        ce.setPatient(new Reference("Patient/RVH1003"));
        ce.getServicedPeriod().setStart(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis())).setEnd(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()));
        ce.setCreated(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()));
        ce.setEnterer(new Reference("http://abcd.com/Tmh01"));
        ce.setProvider(new Reference("Organization/GICOFINDIA"));
        ce.setInsurer(new Reference( "Organization/Tmh01"));
        ce.setFacility(ce.getFacility().setReference("http://sgh.com.sa/Location/4461281"));
        ce.getInsurance().add(new CoverageEligibilityRequest.InsuranceComponent(new Reference("Coverage/COVERAGE1")));

We have now created a CoverageEligibilityRequest object "ce". In order to visualize the object in JSON format we can use the below code

`System.out.println("main res with contained \n" + p.encodeResourceToString(ce));`

CoverageEligibilityRequest Bundle must contain a CoverageEligibilityRequest resource. Users can import and explore a CoverageEligibilityRequest example already created and code is available in file "HCXCoverageEligibility.java. We will also be importing other reference profiles used in CoverageEligibilityRequest example already created
        
        CoverageEligibilityRequest ce = HCXCoverageEligibility.coverageEligibilityRequestExample();
        Organization hos = HCXOrganization.providerOrganizationExample();
        Organization org = HCXOrganization.insurerOrganizationExample();
        Patient pat = HCXPatient.patientExample();
        Coverage cov = HCXCoverage.coverageExample();



Now, we need to add the referenced resources in CoverageEligibilityRequest resource such as Patient, Organizations, Coverage
into the CoverageEligibilityRequest object.

We can now create bundle as per the https://ig.hcxprotocol.io/v0.7.1/StructureDefinition-CoverageEligibilityRequestBundle.html
To create the bundle we can use resourceToBundle function.In the below example, we are using "ce", a coverage eligibility resource
as the main object and an array of other resources which we need in the bundle

        List<DomainResource> domList = List.of(hos,org,pat,cov);
        Bundle bundleTest = new Bundle();
        try{
            bundleTest = HCXFHIRUtils.resourceToBundle(ce, domList, Bundle.BundleType.COLLECTION, "https://ig.hcxprotocol.io/v0.7.1/StructureDefinition-CoverageEligibilityRequestBundle.html");
            System.out.println("reosurceToBundle \n" + p.encodeResourceToString(bundleTest));
        }catch (Exception e){
            System.out.println("Error message " + e.getMessage());
        }




CoverageEligibilityRequest bundle can be used to extract the main resource which is CoverageEligibilityRequest
in this example using the function getPrimaryResource. In case no URL is provided for the SD, first entry in the bundle will be
returned

        DomainResource covRes = HCXFHIRUtils.getPrimaryResource(bundleTest, "https://ig.hcxprotocol.io/v0.7.1/StructureDefinition-CoverageEligibilityRequest.html");
        System.out.println("getPrimaryResource \n" + p.encodeResourceToString(covRes));


CoverageEligibilityRequest bundle can be used to get all the referenced resources in the main resource from the bundle
if present using getReferencedResource. If a URL is passed then, the URL is treated as the main resource and all other
resources in the bundle is returned. If no URL is passed then all resources apart from the first entry is returned

        List<DomainResource> covRef = HCXFHIRUtils.getReferencedResource(bundleTest);
        System.out.println("getReferencedResource \n" + covRef);
